Contributing
=================

We welcome any features/ideas you might have to make angular-toasty even more awesome. If you have an idea you'd like to see implemented, but are unable to assist us by coding this yourself, feel free to make an issue at https://github.com/invertase/angular-toasty/issues!

If you'd like to help code an features/idea yourself, please follow:

#### Requirements

You must have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed, along with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
Once these are installed, install the following global NPM modules:

```
sudo npm install -g bower gulp
```

#### Pull-Requests

To create a pull request, please [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the **development branch** repo! Once done, create a [new branch](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches). If possible, call the branch name something related to your pull request.

To ensure your feature is visible to the public, we ask you include it in the functionality of our examples. 

#### Developing

When making changes, please ensure these are all done within the `src` directory. To build changes, simply run `gulp`.
Once you're happy, run the `gulp --production` command to build your files into the `dist` directory.

Please ensure your feature has an example, which can be added into the `example` directory.
